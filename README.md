<p>The font was made using Figma and FontForge and currently supports the entire Latin alphabet and some symbols (!,.()[ ] #).</p>
<p>It was developed with Soviet Modernist art in mind while also making sure the blocky design are accessible for both digital and print projects. The font pairs best with minimalistic geometry elements as well as monospace and sans-slab fonts.  </p>
